Dev 02 Hospital Project Overview

Our application's architecture prioritizes simplicity and abstraction, leveraging object-oriented programming principles. We've designed it to cater to three user roles: Hospital Administrator, Doctor, and Patient.

Key Features:

• Administrator: Can manage doctors and patients, including addition, deletion, and listing based on various criteria.

• Doctor: Can view and interact with patient and colleague data, similar to the administrator's capabilities.

• Patient: Can browse and interact with doctor information, manage appointments, and assess the urgency of their condition.


Technical Details:

• We've encapsulated functionality within respective service classes like DoctorService and PatientService.

• The application starts with a user-friendly menu, implemented using switch-case logic.

• Data is managed using linked lists, providing flexibility and ease of manipulation.

• We've implemented a layered structure, separating concerns and ensuring a modular design.

• Utilities like a static scanner and custom print methods enhance user experience and code maintainability.
