Dev 02 Hospital Project Overview

Our application's architecture prioritizes simplicity and abstraction, leveraging object-oriented programming principles. We've designed it to cater to three user roles: Hospital Administrator, Doctor, and Patient.

Key Features:

• Administrator: Can manage doctors and patients, including addition, deletion, and listing based on various criteria.
• Doctor: Can view and interact with patient and colleague data, similar to the administrator's capabilities.
• Patient: Can browse and interact with doctor information, manage appointments, and assess the urgency of their condition.

Technical Details:

• We've encapsulated functionality within respective service classes like DoctorService and PatientService.
• The application starts with a user-friendly menu, implemented using switch-case logic.
• Data is managed using linked lists, providing flexibility and ease of manipulation.
• We've implemented a layered structure, separating concerns and ensuring a modular design.
• Utilities like a static scanner and custom print methods enhance user experience and code maintainability.

Feel free to explore the project, conduct tests, and share your feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for your interest!
